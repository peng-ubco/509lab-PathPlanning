This is the starter code for the ENGR 509 lab about path planning, which shows the open street data can be used to create graph so that the search algorithms can be used for path planning.

The code will work properly when you fill in the search algorithm in search_algs.py.

You are encouraged to run different search algorithms and compare their results. 

Also, you can try to use a reinforcement learning algorithm to find the lowest-cost/shorest path.
