This is the starter code for the ENGR 509 lab about path planning, which shows the data from open street map can be converted into a graph so that the search algorithms can be applied for path planning.

The juoyter notebook will run properly when you fill in the search algorithm in search_algs.py.

You are encouraged to try different search algorithms and compare their results. 

Also, you can try to implement a reinforcement learning algorithm to find the lowest-cost/shorest path.
